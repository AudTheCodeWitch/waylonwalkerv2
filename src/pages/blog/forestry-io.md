# Trying out forestry.io

## Sorry Netlify CMS

_I still ♥️ your product_

_forestry is simple_

I have been playing with the netlify cms for a while now and it has been a decent experience, but I **really** struggle configuring it.   Forestry is so simple to setup.  My favorite part is that I can code up my gatsby.js site , storing all editable text in markdown, and come back later and add the CMS based on existing documents.
