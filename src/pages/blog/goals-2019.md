_The year of intenionality_

## professional

This year I will become more productive, by intensionally working on a well thought out plan, learning the right technologies, and leave behind a positive legacy.

### Productivity

Last year I was able to make some great strides in my productivity and focus.  This year I want to be able to bring it up a notch.  **Intentionality** plays a big part in this.  Taking some time to sit down and think about the tasks you realistically want to complete for the day, then focusing on those tasks one at a time.  

I started off the year last year using the **pomodoro** system to focus on one task and one task only for 25 minutes at a time.  This worked really well for me but I quickly fell off of the train and fell into my old trap of reacting to the loudest customer over the items I put **intensionally** on my todo list.

A **kanban** system is key to keeping it intentional.  I currently use a very simple trello system, with very few cards.  This helps to stay on track during those 25 minutes.  During the pomodoro session I move an item from todo, to doing, work that item, then move it to done when it is ready.  The only other thing that I can do during that time is to add items to the todo list.
