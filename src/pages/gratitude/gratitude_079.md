#### Learning Resources

Recently I have been thinking about all of the resources that have been available for me to learn.  I am so grateful to have these at my disposal.  Learning how to improve myself, and increase my productivity in the long run is a  passion of mine.  I spend many days spinning my wheels with something, but I am always learning.  Even though those few hours were lost in the short term, in the long term I always come away having learned something.  These small wins each day cumulativly add up to something that gives me a lot of productivity in my daily work and allows me to succeed.
